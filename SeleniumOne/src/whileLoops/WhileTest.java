		//To use the Scanner class, create an object of the class and use any of the available methods found in the Scanner class documentation. In our example, we will use the nextLine() method, which is used to read Strings:
		
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);	//create a scanner object
		String Namen = "";
		
		
		while(Namen.isBlank()) {
			
			System.out.print("Please tell your name: ");
			Namen = scanner.nextLine();

			System.out.print("Was ist dein Namen ");
			Namen =scanner.nextLine();
			
		 } while(Namen.isBlank()) ;
		
		System.out.println("Guten Tag: "+ Namen);
